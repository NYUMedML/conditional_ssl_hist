# Conditional Self-supervised for histopathology images

This repository contains the code for the paper [Interpretable Prediction of Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma Recurrence With Self-supervised Learning]().

## Introduction
In this study, we explore the morphological features of LSCC recurrence and metastasis with novel SSL method, based on conditional SSL. We propose a sampling mechanism within contrastive SSL framework for histopathology images that avoids overfitting to batch effects.
